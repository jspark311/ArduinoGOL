ArduinoGOL
======================

This implementation of GoL was originally written by user [creativename](http://code.runnable.com/u/creativename). I have improved it slightly and bent it into an Arduino library. Original commentary is preserved where it is still relevant.

I have mutated the [original source](http://code.runnable.com/UwQvQY99xW5AAAAQ/john-conway-s-game-of-life-for-c%2B%2B-nested-for-loops-and-2-dimensional-arrays) to fit this project. I mapped the board onto a toroid. It was a bounded plane.
